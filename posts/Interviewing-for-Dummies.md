Skip the inspirational books and expensive seminars, I can tell you a foolproof, get-rich-quick scheme in eleven words: The key to success is timing, support, experience… and mostly luck.

My friends have heard me say, “If I ever publish a how-to-succeed-in-entrepreneurship book, you have permission to punch me in the face.” Now, full disclosure, if I ever do publish a book on entrepreneurship, I am running for the hills, because my friends are bigger than I am. But, the reason I have made such a ludicrous agreement is because I despise the books preaching an entrepreneurial “golden ticket.” There is no <i>correct</i> way to make a company and there are no secret keys to success. If there were, everyone would be Gate’s and Zuckerberg’s neighbors.

This post is not a rant, I promise. Instead, I would like to talk about a simple, yet critical, technique that does lead to success, not as a standalone key, but as a integral factor. You have to treat people like people. <i>Duh.</i>

My first “successful” interview took place in a Barnes & Nobel when I was a high-schooler going through the whirlwind of college applications. I was sitting at a square, plastic table for two with an alumni recruiter —we’ll call him Mike— from Princeton University. My interview with Mike started of with the expected formalities, but quickly slipped into the topic of a passion we both shared: audio recording techniques. Mike shared his excitement, and pain of recording brass and woodwind instruments which tend to clip due to their highly variable volume. I responded with my grievances of recording with the antiquated combination of software and hardware I had jerry-rigged in my bedroom. Without us realizing, the “interview” went on for twice as long as scheduled. It ended with the Princeton alum saying he would love to have someone as passionate as me at his alma mater. I told him, I appreciated his support, but I would never be accepted due to my test scores, to which he tragicomically agreed. 

No I didn’t get into Princeton. But my interview was certainly memorable. I didn’t have all the <i>right</i> answers to Mike’s questions, but I treated him as a person and we found common ground and explored it. I stood out because I refused to kowtow to a checklist of Princeton’s qualifications. Instead, Mike and I <i>shared</i> an experience and collectively increased our breadth of music recording knowledge. 

The skill of being able to empathize during an interview has continued to serve me well as I have pitched to angel investors and negotiated critical contracts massive corporations. I have met plenty of harsh interviewers who pry with impossible questions, but their intentions are rarely as malicious as they seem. Ask yourself: Would they have even met with you if they weren’t somewhat interested? No, of course not. So why is your silly ass sitting in front of them them, floundering? It’s likely that you don’t know (yet) what they <i>really</i> want. Their facade is meant to test you. They want to scare you, get your mind racing, punch holes in your plan, and most of all they want to see if you can still float after they submerge you. 

A good investor, a solid contractual partner, or a great potential employer have all seen candidates with your stats before. But, if you can think on your feet, and show that you have confidence, knowledge and the ability to motivate, then I guarantee you’ll be seeing more smiles and handshakes by the end of the interview than you did at the beginning. 

The value of seeing through a gruff demeanor and empathizing with the interrogator became very obvious to me during a Maersk Shipping Line case competition. During the Q&A section of our presentation, a terrifyingly intimidating, bald man asked me how I planned to “increase the racial diversity in Maersk’s workforce, across all the ports they served, at the lowest possible cost.” In the spirit of a case competition, I thanked him for his question, paused, and then spouted off the best bullshit I have ever verbalized (a technique I would <i>rarely</i> recommend in a real interview). We won. After we were awarded with our mediocre, framed certificate and some poorly hemmed shirts, the horrifying reincarnate of Mr. Clean came to talk to me. He shook my hand, congratulated me and said, “I had no idea what to ask you, I couldn’t come up with a question, so I went with something I didn’t think you would ever be able to answer. Boy was I wrong. Great job!” Moral of the story, interviewers are often as uncertain as you are.

Owning a company and being on the other side of the table has opened up my eyes. Once I started conducting interviews, I realized why the “human empathizers” usually win. I can read through your resume and see <i>what</i> you’ve done and <i>why</i> you’re qualified to fill a position, but that does nothing for me. The missing element is substance; I want to engage on a personal level and see what energy you are bringing into my office. If the goal of an interview was regurgitating a resume, I’d save my time and nix the face-to-face. Hell, now days I could probably skip any human interaction at all and employ a piece of software. But I don’t. I look for people who can contribute. I look for people who can make my company thrive more than just function. A kiss-ass, yes-man can’t do that. 

Interviewing all comes down to confidence. A cliche, yes, but there’s a reason that advice gets repeated like a deeply scratched record. I urge you to ask yourself: Do you have the confidence to let your resume speak for itself, the confidence to realize you and I are equally quirky human beings for whom emotions resonate better than hard data, the confidence to recommend a superior alternative even if it creates discourse? If so, I want to work with you. 

If none of this has stuck, then leave with this: An interview, of any sort, should be treated like a potential friendship. The best way to approach a future friend isn't with unwarranted praise and idolization, but by increasing your combined value through mutual appreciation, efficiency and innovation. The best friendships feel equal, and the best interactions in the business world are no different. When it comes right down to it, we are all people. <i>Duh.</i>
