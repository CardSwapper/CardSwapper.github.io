<p>In my last post I wrote about a phenomenon I entitled “the Startup Bubble.” For a more positive bent, I thought it would be interesting to examine how successful applications have overcome the continued saturation of the app market. </p>
<p>With any industry, as more companies enter the competition, each additional firm must be niched in order to attract customers. Usually, the first few companies to enter the market will duke it out to service the general market. Once a company wins the proverbial king-of-the-hill game, newcomers are left scrambling for the remaining options: lower price, higher quality, cooler features, etc. </p>
<p>As we established, any developer can start the next app sensation. The only limiting factor in the infinitely scalable software world is being first to market. But when the market has seemingly been depleted of new mediums for services, what comes next? Let’s take a look at a timeline that us millennials will remember well and see why the apps we use caught on.

<h4 id="the-game-of-kings-">The Game of Kings:</h4>
<p>Users-now-and-profit-after is the business model nearly every social network operates on. The rational is: if there are users on the network to sell to, we will find a way to…later. As ridiculous as this seems, investors in the early 2000’s were willing to sink money into the model because it differentiated from the over-inflated stocks that lead to the dot-com bubble. User acquisition was a metric that could be followed when P/E ratios had seemingly failed. </p>
<p>In August of 2003, eUniverse employees launched Myspace, a social network that filled in the holes of Friendster. Rapidly, top-friends, customizable home pages and Tom became integral parts of lives. In 2005, MySpace balked at an opportunity to purchase a startup from its socially awkward owner for a lofty $75 million. That small startup went on to bury Myspace, and Mark Zuckerberg became the worlds youngest self-made billionaire. </p>
<p>In 2005, Bebo tried its hand at being <em>the</em> social network and in 2011 Google launched Google+. But the race was already won, Facebook had killed the competition and only furthered its grasp in the market by making the password obsolete. “Login with Facebook” had become common-place. Plain and simple, Facebook had rooted its way into everyone’s lives whether they liked it or not. </p>

<h4 id="birth-of-specialty-apps-">Birth of Specialty Apps:</h4>
<p>The battle for social network king only stoked the fire of the social network war. In 2005 we saw the birth of video-specific networking with YouTube which quickly beat up on its direct competitor Vimeo. In the same year, a new way to aggregate news was launched. Reddit quickly found a dedicated cult following and its users further developed the scope of the network, boadening its usability to images, videos, user-created content and much more, all under the veil on anonymity. </p>
<p>In 2006 a new powerhouse took flight. Twitter was launched and the world adapted their lives to 140 characters of text. This is when things started getting interesting. Twitter’s main feature was a limitation. Sure, you could tweet at people, use hashtags and have followers, but the main differential with Twitter was the text limit. By having a hard and fast 140 character cap, content was quick, easy and constant. A new tweet could go from thought to reality in seconds! Who would have thought giving <em>less</em> options would be a selling point. </p>
<h4 id="bigger-than-jesus-">Bigger than Jesus:</h4>
<p>Way back in 2000, Pandora Radio began streaming audio, but in no way was it a social network. That being said, Pandora paved the way for other online music streaming services. In 2007, Soundcloud took the music production world by storm (and stole ground from the Hype Machine) as the social space to share audio creations, whether or not you were creating from scratch or sampling other artist’s tracks. Despite the Soundcloud’s entrenchment in the artist sharing space, a gap remained in the arena of mainstream music. Grooveshark took a shot at the market in 2007, but its laissez-faire attitude toward copyrights resulted in removal from the Google, Apple and Facebook app stores. Come 2008, a floundering music app caught everyones attention. Spotify seemed like an weak contender as the company continued to lose money and test a menagerie of pricing models. Against the odds, the competition held out, and Spotify struck gold in 2012 after securing deals with the major record labels and launching its mobile application. In 2014, Spotify Student brought the ads-free mobile service to collegiates at an affordable price, raising its active user-ship up to 40 million (a quarter of which are paying subscribers). The multi-billion dollar music industry had found its unlikely underdog. </p>

<h4 id="go-mobile-or-go-home-">Go Mobile or Go Home:</h4>
<p>As the 2000’s came to a close, our phones took over our lives. In 2009 Foursquare built out the functionality of the GPS we attached to our hip. As Twitter used text caps, Foursquare limited users based on their physical location. The only way for you to interact with the people, or more likely, <em>places</em> you liked, was to go to them. </p>
<p>Then came the most simple social network yet: Instagram. Like Twitter for pictures, Instagram limited its users to a 1:1 ratio picture, some cool looking filters and a bit of text. The app worked because the camera phone was ubiquitous and everyone wanted to get recognition for their artistic chops. The thrill of watching likes accumulate on a photo was valuable and the potential for marketing was infinite. Instagram was acquired by Facebook for a cool billion bucks. </p>
<p>In 2010 an attempt at limitation failed. Path, a social network similar to Facebook, tried to limit its users to 100 friends. The idea was simple but the limitation lacked creativity. Path users were limited of the <em>sake</em> of being limited. What if I have more than 100 friends? Too bad! What if I reach the cap and want to add someone else? Better delete somebody! The model didn&#39;t work. If you are going to restrict your user, the disability needs to either streamline creativity or focus the content, any other outcome and you’ve merely severed functionality. </p>
<h4 id="-15-billion-for-10-seconds-">$15 Billion for 10 seconds:</h4>
<p>In 2011 the most absurd social media was launched. Snapchat, an app seemingly tailored at the risqué-photo market, exploded in popularity. Up to this point, Snapchat is the most successful example of well-crafted user limitation. As nearly everyone knows, Snapchats expire after viewing them and their duration spans from 1 to 10 seconds. The photo/video-sharing application caught on because it was easy to understand and even easier to use. <em>I can send whatever I want, whenever I want and look as stupid as I want with little to no ramifications. How great is that?!</em> Better yet, Facebook tried to copy Snapchat with their “Pokes” application. Pokes crashed and burned which was a beautiful testimony to the fact that money and power can’t always buy success, sometimes being first is all that matters. And, the investors seemed to agree. Over the course of a few years, Snapchat went from launch, to being valued at $15 billion in 2014, putting it amongst the ranks of the other highest valued private companies: Uber, Palantir and SpaceX. What’s crazy is Snapchat didn’t particularly create anything astounding. Its like Instagram with expiration dates, but it worked and it was original <em>enough</em>.</p>

<h4 id="give-me-less-and-give-it-now-">Give Me Less and Give it Now:</h4>
<p>So why do people like limitation? In a era where consumers want everything as fast as possible, it seems counterintuitive that we would want software that did less, right? Wrong. It has to do with human nature. Consumers like organization and we like knowing that we are getting the best of the best. If a product does too much it feels like it isn’t specialized. The power of minimalism is important because it streamlines understanding, usability and design. And, with nearly unlimited storage on our phones, a few, simple, well-working apps far outdo a single, cluttered, multi-purpose app. </p>
<p>Furthermore, we download applications that are more and more limited because these apps satisfy specific needs that general applications either cannot do, or don’t do well enough. It’s hard to say how many more specialized or limited apps will successfully enter the marketplace, but if the past is any indication, a simple, piggy-backing idea with great execution is just as valuable, if not more so, as one that is completely revolutionary. </p>
